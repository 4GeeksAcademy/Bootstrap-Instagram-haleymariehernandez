Instagram Feed

Overview
This project is a simplified Instagram-like web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using Bootstrap 5 for styling and responsiveness. It features a navigation bar, a modal for creating new posts, and a gallery of images that can be viewed in either a grid or inline layout. The application allows users to upload images, add captions, and toggle between display modes, mimicking core Instagram functionalities.

Create Post Modal: Allows users to upload an image, preview it, add a caption, and share the post (simulated with an alert).

Grid View: Displays images in a 3-column grid (responsive to 1-column on smaller screens).
Inline View: Shows images with titles, dates, likes, and comments in a centered, single-column layout.
Responsive Design: Utilizes Bootstrap's grid system and custom CSS for a mobile-friendly experience.
Sample Posts: Includes 9 sample images from Pexels with predefined metadata (titles, dates, likes, comments).
